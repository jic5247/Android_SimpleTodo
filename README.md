# Android_SimpleTodo

Time spent: around 6 hours

Completed User Stories:

* [x] Successfully add and remove items from the todo list within my app
* [x] Include support for editing todo items
* [x] Persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart
 
Notes:

Spended around 3 hours to watch the walk-thought videos to set up "Android Studio" and type codes for the initial 2 user stories. Spended around another 3 hours to design the second activity of edit item and did research on "StartActvityForResult()", Intent and Intent.putExtras(). This is a very out-standing introductory tutorial to a beginner toward Android development.

Walkthrough of all user stories:
